	'introduction': 'We provide 45 multi-sequence CMR images from patients who underwent cardiomyopathy. Each patient had been scanned using the three CMR sequences, i.e. the LGE, T2 and bSSFP. The task of this challenge is to segment the ventricles and myocardium from LGE CMR, combing with other two sequences (T2 and bSSFP) from same patients, which can be used to assist the LGE CMR segmentation.'

	'introduction': 'Accurate computing, modeling and analysis of the whole heart substructures is important in the development of clinical applications. Segmentation and registration of whole heart images is however challenging and still relies heavily on manual work, which is time-consuming and prone to errors.<br>The Challenge provides 120 multi-modality cardiac images acquired in real clinical environment. It aims at creating an open and fair competition for various research groups to test and validate their methods, particularly for the multi-modality whole heart segmentation. It is not only to benchmark various whole heart segmentation algorithms, but also to cover the topic of general cardiac image segmentation and registration and modeling.'

	'introduction': 'zxhproj (doxygen html) is a medical image computing platform, being developed and maintained by Xiahai Zhuang since 2004. Based on it, several image registration and segmentation tools have been developed, such as multivariate mixture model, cardiac segmentation, locally affine registration method (LARM), spatially encoded mutual information (SEMI), as well as other image/vector field processing tools. The tools work with nifty (nii/nii.gz) and gipl short int data formats. '
