## Script

For the sake of evaluation, we now publish all the ground truth of test data (40 CT + 40 MRI), which have been cloaked by encryption. The matlab script for the evaluation is "matlab_evaluation_script.m", where the required tools used in the script have also be attached, including:
zxhCardWhsEvaluate.exe
zxhimageop.exe (you may use it to check the information of the image)
zxhtransform.exe

Note that the zxhCardWhsEvaluate.exe could decoder the ground truth when you evaluated your results.
To understand the excel files you generated, please kindly input the zxhCardWhsEvaluate in your cmd system, where the acronyms are,
LV: left ventricle (label: 500)
Myo: myocardium of left ventricle (label: 205)
EPI: epicardium surface of left ventricle
RV: right ventricle (label: 600)
LA: left atrium (label: 420)
RA: right atrium (label: 550)
LO/AO: trunk of ascending aorta (label: 820)
PA: trunk of pulmonary artery (label: 850)
Chm: chambers
WH: whole heart
